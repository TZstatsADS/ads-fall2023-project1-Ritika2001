### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2023

+ Projec title: What made you happy today?
+ This project is conducted by Ritika Nandi

+ Project summary: What causes happiness? This question has been the center of interdisciplinary research work for years. Psychologists, linguists, philosophers, and scientists have collaborated time and again, using several different approaches to take a crack at this elusive problem.

The age of the internet has brought about a revolution in terms of the sheer volume of data available for analysis, opening new avenues and spawning the branch of data science. 

An analysis of over 100,000 responses to the question “What made you happy in the last 24 hours” was analyzed, and the results are 'interesting', to say the least.
